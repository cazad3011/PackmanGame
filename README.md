## PackmanGame

This is a console based Packman game which has been designed in C programming language using manhattan distance and A star algorithms.

## DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

PackmanGame.c is the main file of this project which contains C codes for console based Packman game. All files have been placed inside
PackmanGame directory.

## HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN

Use the basic commands of windows or linux operating system for compiling and running the game.
At first compile PackmanGame.c and then run it.

This package is available on an "as is" basis. I do not say or imply that it will be useful for 
whatever you want to do with it. It may also contain bugs, and I assume no responsibility for 
any potential problems associated with its use. However,I have tried to fix almost bugs of my 
program. It has been tested on an Intel(R) Core(TM) CPU (i5) with a 2.20 GHz processor and 8.00 GB of RAM, running on the Windows 10 operating system.
